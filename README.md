# Todo-List-
Use CSS and JavaScript to create a "to-do list" to organize and prioritize your tasks.
  lists that I generally is use to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list of everything that have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.
 # The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:
Add tasks,
Update tasks,
Read tasks,
Delete tasks;
